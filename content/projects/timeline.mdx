## Project Overview

Timeline is a mobile social networking application that reimagines how users create and consume content. Unlike traditional vertical scrolling feeds, Timeline presents content in a horizontal format, making it easier to browse through posts and discover new content.

## The Challenge

Traditional social media platforms have limited post creation options and vertical feeds that can feel overwhelming. Users wanted:
- More creative control over their posts
- A different way to browse content
- Faster content discovery
- Better performance on mobile devices

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Architecture
Built with React Native for cross-platform compatibility, the app features:
- Custom post creation engine with 15+ layout templates
- Real-time preview system for post editing
- Smooth horizontal scrolling with gesture support
- Optimized image loading and caching

### Backend Infrastructure
The backend is built with Spring Boot and deployed on AWS:
- RESTful API with JWT authentication
- PostgreSQL database with connection pooling
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- AWS S3 for media storage
- Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes

### DevOps & Deployment
Implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline:
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and building
- Docker containerization for consistent environments
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- AWS EKS for managed Kubernetes service

## Key Features

### Custom Post Creation
Users can choose from various post layouts including:
- Photo grids (2x2, 3x3, 4x4)
- Story-style layouts
- Quote and text posts
- Mixed media posts

### Horizontal Feed
The signature horizontal scrolling feed provides:
- Smooth infinite scrolling
- Lazy loading for optimal performance
- Gesture-based navigation
- Quick post previews

### Performance Optimizations
- Image compression and progressive loading
- Database query optimization
- CDN integration for global content delivery
- Background sync for offline support

## Results & Impact

The project successfully delivered on all key objectives:

- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in time spent browsing content
- **Performance**: 40% reduction in feed load times
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime achieved through robust infrastructure
- **Development Efficiency**: Deployment time reduced from 2 hours to 15 minutes

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me valuable lessons about:
- Building scalable mobile applications
- Implementing complex UI interactions
- Managing cloud infrastructure
- Establishing effective CI/CD pipelines
- Performance optimization for mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
- AI-powered content recommendations
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Social features (comments, sharing)
- Cross-platform web version
- Integration with other social platforms
