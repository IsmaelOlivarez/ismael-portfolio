## Project Overview

Superchat is a modern, real-time web chat application built with Next.js and Firebase. It provides instant messaging capabilities with a clean, responsive interface that works seamlessly across all devices.

## The Challenge

Creating a chat application that was:
- Simple to use without complex setup
- Real-time with minimal latency
- Responsive across all device sizes
- Secure and user-friendly
- Easy to deploy and maintain

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Architecture
Built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript:
- **App Router**: Used Next.js 14 App Router for modern routing
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components with consistent design

### Real-time Communication
Firebase integration for instant messaging:
- **Firestore**: Real-time database for message storage and synchronization
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with multiple sign-in methods
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage for file and image sharing
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting for deployment

### State Management
React Hooks and Context API:
- **Custom Hooks**: Created hooks for chat functionality
- **Context**: Global state management for user authentication
- **Local Storage**: Persistent user preferences and settings
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for better UX

## Key Features

### Real-time Messaging
- **Instant Delivery**: Sub-100ms message delivery using Firestore listeners
- **Typing Indicators**: Shows when users are typing
- **Online Status**: Real-time online/offline user indicators
- **Message History**: Persistent chat history with pagination

### User Authentication
- **Email/Password**: Traditional authentication method
- **Google OAuth**: One-click sign-in with Google accounts
- **Anonymous Chat**: Option to chat without creating accounts
- **Profile Management**: User profiles with customizable avatars

### Responsive Design
